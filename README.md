### Hey 👋 I'm Sarah (Sm10259)

I'm a Computer Science Senior at the University of Central Florida ⚔️ and a full-stack developer!

I currently manage the technology and digital experiences for [Imagineering Parks](https://imagineeringparks.com)! I also contribute to Open Source projects and develop a few Minecraft plugins.

🖥️ Check out my [portfolio website](http://sarahmyerson.com) for a showcase of things I have done and some experiments I've created in the past.

👻 I also enjoy creative writing, distance running, and theme park design!
